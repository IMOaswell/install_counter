### Can u use this on ur phone?
No.... u can try but i dont recommend to do so.

### The heck is this?
idk. its an app that allows me to record my devlog progress.
In short, its a side project i worked on to procrastinate.Â 

### Why is this even here?
maybe to teach me how to use git, idk.

this app requires a bunch of steps to properly install and im lazy to write all of it:D.

e.g installing termux and termux:api, install git, manually setting the storage permission, allowing termux permission, creating git repository on ur project using mGit.

..So dont even attempt to install it:D
